## Installing vs Updating

If you're updating vMenu, instead of installing it from scratch, you need to make sure that you REPLACE **ALL** files, **EXCEPT** your `permissions.cfg` and all files in the `vMenu/config/` folder!

!!! warning
    **IMPORTANT**: Before installing vMenu, make sure your **[FXServer artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/)** are up to date. Yes update the server. Just do it. Don't be lazy and come crying if it doesn't work because you didn't update the server.

!!! warning
    **IMPORTANT**: If you're updating vMenu from any version below v3.3.0, and you want to keep your saved bans, please read the changelog for the update [here](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu/releases/tag/v3.3.0-pre).


## Installation steps
1. Go to the RELEASES page (on the GitHub repo), and download "vMenu-\<version\>.zip", or use the "Download vMenu" button on the left side of this page to automatically download the latest version.
2. Once you've got your zip file, extract the files and copy everything into `/resources/vMenu/` so that you end up with the `fxmanifest.lua` (previously `__resource.lua`) file right here: `/resources/vMenu/fxmanifest.lua`.
!!! note
    If you're trying to join the server, and it gives you an error saying "Could not load resource vMenu" or something similar, then make sure that you've installed vMenu inside `/resources/vMenu/` and NOT inside `/resources/vMenu/vMenu/`! Also note that the resource folder name **MUST** be called `vMenu` (Case Sensitive!!!) or the script will not work.
!!! note 
    3. Now that you've got your files inside `/resources/vMenu/`, go into the `/resources/vMenu/config/` folder and edit the `permissions.cfg` file to your liking.
    4. Go to your `server.cfg` file, and add `exec @vMenu/config/permissions.cfg` **ABOVE** the `ensure vMenu` line (add `ensure vMenu` if you haven't done that already). It's very important that you FIRST execute the permissions file, and THEN start/ensure vMenu. Otherwise vMenu will not function correctly!
!!! tip
    Alternatively, if you don't want to mess with any of these installation steps, install vMenu using their one-click installer! Don't have a FiveM server yet? Click [here](https://zap-hosting.com/vespura2) to get a server, and use the code `Vespura-a-3715` at checkout for a 10% discount!

5. Save the server.cfg file and start your server. Once you're in, you should be able to access most menu's just fine without having to configure anything inside the `permissions.cfg`. This is because it is setup to have certain permissions for everyone by default, only administrator/moderator sensitive options have been removed from the default permissions file.

Congratulations, you've just installed vMenu in it's most basic, plug-and-play configuration.


* To learn more about the **configuration options** that vMenu has to offer, checkout the [Configuration](/vmenu/configuration/) page.
* To learn more on how to **setup the permissions.cfg file**, take a look at the [Permissions Reference](/vmenu/permissions-ref/) page.
